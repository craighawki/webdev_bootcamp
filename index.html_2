        Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are marine molluscs of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda which
        also
        includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which is
        used
        for control of buoyancy.

        Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with
        which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest
        species,
        the giant cuttlefish (Sepia apama), reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass.[3]

        Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators
        include
        dolphins, sharks, fish, seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The typical life expectancy of a cuttlefish is
        about
        1–2 years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent invertebrates.[4] Cuttlefish
        also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.[4]

        The "cuttle" in cuttlefish comes from the Old English name for the species, cudele, which may be cognate with
        the
        Old Norse koddi (cushion) and the Middle Low German Kudel (rag).[5] The Greco-Roman world valued the cuttlefish
        as a
        source of the unique brown pigment the creature releases from its siphon when it is alarmed. The word for it in
        both
        Greek and Latin, sepia, now refers to the reddish-brown color sepia in English.

    <h2>Fossil record</h2>
    <p>
        The earliest fossils of cuttlefish are from the end of the Cretaceous period,[6][7] represented by Ceratisepia
        from
        the Late Maastrichtian Maastricht Formation of the Netherlands.[8] Although the Jurassic Trachyteuthis was
        historically considered possibly related to cuttlefish,[9] later studies considered to be more closely related
        to
        octopus and vampire squid.[10]

    <h2>Anatomy and physiology</h2>
    <h3>Visual system</h3>
    <p>
        The characteristic W-shape of the cuttlefish eye
        Pupil expansion in Sepia officinalis
        Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes. The organogenesis and the final structure of the
        cephalopod eye fundamentally differ from those of vertebrates such as humans.[15] Superficial similarities
        between
        cephalopod and vertebrate eyes are thought to be examples of convergent evolution. The cuttlefish pupil is a
        smoothly curving W-shape.[16][17] Although cuttlefish cannot see color,[18] they can perceive the polarization
        of
        light, which enhances their perception of contrast. They have two spots of concentrated sensor cells on their
        retinas (known as foveae), one to look more forward, and one to look more backward. The eye changes focus by
        shifting the position of the entire lens with respect to the retina, instead of reshaping the lens as in
        mammals.
        Unlike the vertebrate eye, no blind spot exists, because the optic nerve is positioned behind the retina. They
        are
        capable of using stereopsis, enabling them to discern depth/distance because their brain calculates the input
        from
        both eyes.[19][20]
    </p>

        The cuttlefish's eyes are thought to be fully developed before birth, and they start observing their
        surroundings
        while still in the egg. In consequence, they may prefer to hunt the prey they saw before hatching.[21]
    </p>
    <h3>Circulatory system</h3>
    <p>
        The blood of a cuttlefish is an unusual shade of green-blue, because it uses the copper-containing protein
        haemocyanin to carry oxygen instead of the red, iron-containing protein haemoglobin found in vertebrates' blood.
        The
        blood is pumped by three separate hearts: two branchial hearts pump blood to the cuttlefish's pair of gills (one
        heart for each), and the third pumps blood around the rest of the body. Cuttlefish blood must flow more rapidly
        than
        that of most other animals because haemocyanin carries substantially less oxygen than haemoglobin. Unlike most
        other
        mollusks, cephalopods like cuttlefish have a closed circulatory system.[22]

    <h2>Cuttlebone</h2>
    <h3>Main article: Cuttlebone</h3>

    <p>
        Top and bottom view of a cuttlebone, the buoyancy organ and internal shell of a cuttlefish
        Cuttlefish possess an internal structure called the cuttlebone, which is porous and is made of aragonite. The
        pores
        provide it with buoyancy, which the cuttlefish regulates by changing the gas-to-liquid ratio in the chambered
        cuttlebone via the ventral siphuncle.[23] Each species' cuttlebone has a distinct shape, size, and pattern of
        ridges
        or texture. The cuttlebone is unique to cuttlefish, and is one of the features that distinguish them from their
        squid relatives.[24]
